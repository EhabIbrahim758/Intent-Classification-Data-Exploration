# Intent-Classification-Data-Exploration
## Project Description
In this Notebooks i have made an exploration and visualization of different intent classification datasets and i have compared between the statistics of these different datasets

## Approach
1. I have used different techniques to read and preprocess the data as some of the data is csv format and other are json and also tsv format 
2. I have used different methods in panndas to explore the unique intent values 
3. Visualize some statistics about the word frequency in each data 
4. Visualize some statistics about the dialogues in each data
5. Visualize some statistics about the messages in each data
6. Compare between results in each dataset
7. Create word cloud for each data

## Solution Architecture
1. Data Reading
2. Data processing
3. Get Statistics about the data 
4. Some Visualization
5. Word Cloud

## How to replicte the work on any dataset
1. check the type of the data format 
2. you can only modify the path of the dataset and modify some column names 
3. run the code and you will get the results

## Output Results And Conclusion
some of the data are good and clear and showed a clear output in the word cloud and some of them is worse in the format they saved so the output isn't well

## Average Time in each task
1. ABCD Data --> 3 hours 
2. Apiza Corpus --> 3 hours
3. EM Acts --> 1.5 hours
4. EMOTyDA --> 1.5 hours
5. SLT 2018 --> 3 hours
